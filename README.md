# virocore-playground

This is the playground for learning and experimenting the ViroCore SDK. This repo provides a foundation for usage of ViroCore in android applications. 

The aim of the experiment is to:

* Provide a basic understanding on usage of ViroCore SDK for Augmented Reality needs.
* Leverage the capabilities of idiomatic kotlin to create a concise version of [ViroCore](https://github.com/viromedia/virocore) java project.

# Dependencies
*  Kotlin stdlib
*  kotlin-android plugin

## Features
* The first sample is ARPlacingObjects on the planes. This sample basically builds an AR scene that lets the user place and drag objects. 
Tap on the 'Viro' button to get a dialog of objects to place in the scene. 
Once placed, the objects can be dragged, rotated, and scaled using pinch and rotate gestures.
