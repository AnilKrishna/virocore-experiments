# ARPlacingObjectsKt
Conversion of ARPlacingObjects to Kotlin.

This version of the app is called ARPlacingObjectsKt, and provides a foundation for usage of ViroCore in android applications. The sample aims to:

* Provide a basic understanding on usage of ViroCore SDK for rendering objects.
* Leverage idiomatic kotlin to improve readability and limit verbosity, as compared to the [ARPlacingObjects](https://github.com/viromedia/virocore/tree/master/ARPlacingObjects) java project.

# Dependencies
*  Kotlin stdlib
*  kotlin-android plugin

## Features

### Complexity - understandability
