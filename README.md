# ViroCore-Playground

This is the playground for learning and experiment with the [ViroAR](https://viromedia.com/viroar/) from 
[ViroMedia](https://viromedia.com/) for AR experiences on [ARCore Supported Devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)

* This repo provides a foundation for usage of [ViroCore](https://viromedia.com/virocore/) in android application.
* Leverage the capabilities of idiomatic kotlin to create a concise kotlin version of [ViroCore Java Project](https://github.com/viromedia/virocore).

# Dependencies
*  ViroCore
*  ARCore
*  Kotlin stdlib
*  kotlin-android plugin

## Features
* The ARPlacingObjects experience sample basically builds an AR scene that lets the user place and drag objects. 
Tap on the placing objects icon to get a dialog of objects to place in the scene. Once placed, the objects can be dragged, rotated, and scaled using pinch and rotate gestures.

* Car model experience sample demonstrates how to use an AR-ImageTarget. 
When a Tesla logo is detected, a 3D Tesla car is created over the logo, along with controls that let the user to view the car model in different colours.

* Movie poster experience demonstrates how to use an AR-ImageTarget: in this case, when a Black Panther poster is recognised, a Black Panther model will jump out of the poster.
