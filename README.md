# virocore-playground

This is the playground for learning and experimenting the ViroCore SDK. This repo provides a foundation for usage of ViroCore in android applications. 

The aim of the experiment is to:

* Provide a basic understanding on usage of ViroCore SDK for Augmented Reality needs.
* Leverage the capabilities of idiomatic kotlin to create a concise version of [ViroCore](https://github.com/viromedia/virocore) java project.

# Dependencies
*  Kotlin stdlib
*  kotlin-android plugin

## Features
* The ARPlacingObjects experience sample basically builds an AR scene that lets the user place and drag objects. 
Tap on the placing objects icon to get a dialog of objects to place in the scene. Once placed, the objects can be dragged, rotated, and scaled using pinch and rotate gestures.

* Car model experience sample demonstrates how to use an AR-ImageTarget. 
When a Tesla logo is detected, a 3D Tesla car is created over the logo, along with controls that let the user to view the car model in different colours.

* Movie poster experience demonstrates how to use an AR-ImageTarget: in this case, when a Black Panther poster is recognised, a Black Panther model will jump out of the poster.
